  "title": "Skyborn: High-Performance Climate Data Analysis Toolkit",
  "description": "Skyborn is a comprehensive Python library for atmospheric and climate science data analysis, featuring high-performance Fortran/Cython implementations with OpenMP/SIMD optimization. Core capabilities include: (1) Atmospheric circulation analysis with windspharm (spherical harmonics, streamfunction/velocity potential, Rossby wave analysis) and geostrophic wind calculations; (2) Tropical cyclone dynamics (Genesis Potential Index, potential intensity calculations based on Emanuel's thermodynamic theory); (3) Statistical trend analysis (Mann-Kendall test, Spearman/Kendall/Pearson correlations) with xarray integration; (4) Tropopause height calculations following WMO standards; (5) Data interpolation (gridfill Poisson solver, CMIP6 regridding, RCM-to-point/grid transformations); (6) Emergent constraints methods for climate sensitivity analysis; (7) Advanced scientific visualization tools. Designed for processing multi-dimensional climate model outputs and reanalysis datasets with automatic dimension detection and metadata preservation.",
