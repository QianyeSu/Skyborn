Version 0.3.12.post1 (Current)
-------------------------------

**üîß Critical Bug Fixes**

* **Fixed spharm Module Wheel Packaging**: Resolved critical issue where compiled Fortran extensions (``_spherepack*.pyd`` files) were missing from wheel distributions built via GitHub CI

  - **Root Cause**: Meson build system was installing to system paths instead of setuptools build directory
  - **Solution**: Configured meson to install directly to setuptools build directory using ``--python.purelibdir`` and ``--python.platlibdir`` parameters
  - **Impact**: Users can now install pre-compiled wheels with full spharm functionality

* **Improved Build System Integration**: Streamlined meson-setuptools integration for better maintainability

  - **Enhanced setup.py**: Added auto-discovery of meson modules for future extensibility
  - **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex file copying mechanisms in favor of native meson installation
  - **Better Error Handling**: Improved build process reliability across platforms

* **Fixed macOS Wheel Building**: Resolved OpenMP dependency compatibility issues

  - **Issue**: ``libgomp.1.dylib`` required minimum macOS 14.0 target version
  - **Solution**: Set ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0`` in GitHub Actions workflow
  - **Note**: macOS 13 users can still install from source using ``pip install --no-binary=skyborn skyborn``

**üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements**

* **Enhanced Meson Configuration**:

  - Changed from ``install: false`` to ``install: true`` with proper ``install_dir`` configuration
  - Maintained smart copying logic for ``--inplace`` builds
  - Enhanced cross-platform compatibility

* **Streamlined GitHub Actions**:

  - Updated wheel building workflow for better OpenMP library handling
  - Ensures compatibility with modern macOS development environments
  - Improved build reliability and error reporting

**‚úÖ Validation**

* Successfully tested wheel building and installation across all supported platforms
* Confirmed ``_spherepack*.pyd`` files are correctly included in wheel distributions
* Verified functionality through comprehensive installation tests
